          <h2>Nail Trim Packages</h2>
          <p class="pb-4">Regular nail trims are essential for healthy & happy pets. Not only can long nails get snagged
            in the carpet & hurt you when your pet jumps on your lap, it can also be painful for your pet. In dogs, long
            nails can cause the feet to splay out & put extra pressure on the toes.
            Long term, this can cause shoulder, elbow & knee injuries, & can also contribute to arthritis. For geriatric
            dogs & active sporting dogs it is even more important to have short nails because long nails can hinder
            balance.</p>
