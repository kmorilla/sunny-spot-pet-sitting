      `Regular nail trims are essential for healthy & happy pets. Not only can long nails get snagged
        in the carpet & hurt you when your pet jumps on your lap, it can also be painful for your pet. In dogs, long
        nails can cause the feet to splay out & put extra pressure on the toes.
        Long term, this can cause shoulder, elbow & knee injuries, & can also contribute to arthritis. For geriatric
        dogs & active sporting dogs it is even more important to have short nails because long nails can hinder
        balance.`
